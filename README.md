# Code-Coach: Your Personal CLI Coding Mentor



**An AI-powered command-line tool to analyze, explain, refactor, and help you learn from your own code.**

Code-Coach acts as your personal code reviewer and tutor, directly in your terminal. It leverages modern AI techniques to provide insightful feedback that goes beyond simple linting, helping you write better, more efficient code and deepen your understanding of programming concepts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üéì In-Depth Explanations:** Ask the tool to explain a complex function or an entire script in plain English.
*   **üöÄ Smart Refactoring:** Get concrete suggestions for improving code readability, performance, and adherence to best practices.
*   **üêõ Bug Detection:** Identify potential bugs and security vulnerabilities, like hard-coded secrets or inefficient loops.
*   **üß† Interactive Quizzing:** Test your own knowledge. The tool generates questions about your code to ensure you understand its logic and potential edge cases.
*   **üéØ Focused Analysis:** Direct the tool to focus on specific goals, such as performance, security, or readability.

## üîß How It Works: The AI Core

Code-Coach isn't just a simple script that sends your code to an AI. It uses a sophisticated combination of modern AI techniques to provide structured, context-aware feedback.

### 1. Function Calling: The Brain of the Operation

At its core, Code-Coach uses **Function Calling**. We don't just ask the AI to "check the code." Instead, we provide it with a set of tools (functions) it can use, such as:

*   `explain_code(code_snippet)`
*   `suggest_refactorings(code_snippet, goal)`
*   `generate_quiz_questions(code_snippet)`
*   `identify_potential_bugs(code_snippet)`

When you run a command like `coach refactor my_app.py`, the AI's job is to analyze your request and your code, then decide which function is the most appropriate to call. It returns a structured command, like `{"function_name": "suggest_refactorings", "arguments": ...}`, which our application then executes. This makes the tool's behavior predictable and powerful.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Beyond General Knowledge

To give you expert-level advice, Code-Coach uses **RAG**. Instead of relying solely on the AI's pre-trained knowledge, the tool first *retrieves* relevant information from a specialized knowledge base.

For example, when analyzing a Python script that uses the `pandas` library, the tool will:
1.  **Identify:** Recognize the use of Python and the `pandas` library.
2.  **Retrieve:** Pull relevant best-practice documents, such as the official **PEP 8 style guide** and articles on **efficient pandas data manipulation**.
3.  **Augment:** Inject this context directly into the prompt sent to the AI.

This ensures the suggestions you receive are not just generic, but are based on official documentation and established best practices for the specific tools you are using.

### 3. Structured Output: Clear and Actionable Feedback

We instruct the AI to return its findings in a clean, structured format (like JSON). The Code-Coach CLI then parses this output to present it in a human-readable and organized way.

Instead of a wall of text, you get clearly delineated sections for `Readability`, `Performance`, and `Security`, making the feedback easy to digest and act upon.

## üöÄ Usage Examples

Here‚Äôs how you would interact with Code-Coach from your terminal:

#### 1. Get a General Review of Your Code

Run `coach` with the `review` command to get a holistic analysis covering readability, performance, and potential bugs.

```bash
coach review my_script.py
```

**Example Output:**

```
Code Analysis for: my_script.py
---------------------------------

### üí° Readability Suggestions:

*   **Line 15:** Variable name `d` is not descriptive. Consider renaming to `user_data_dict`.
*   **Line 28:** Function `proc_data` is too long. Consider breaking it down.

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements:

*   **Line 35:** You are using a `for` loop to iterate over a Pandas DataFrame.
    *   **Suggestion:** Use the vectorized method `df['column'] * 2` instead.
    *   **Estimated Speedup:** ~50x faster.

### üîí Security Risks:

*   **Line 45:** An API key is hard-coded.
    *   **Action:** Move it to an environment variable or secrets manager.
```

#### 2. Explain a Specific Piece of Code

Use the `explain` command to get a natural language description of a file or function.

```bash
coach explain my_api_client.js --function "fetchData"
```

#### 3. Get Refactoring Suggestions for a Specific Goal

Use the `refactor` command with a goal to get targeted advice.

```bash
coach refactor data_processor.py --goal "performance"
```

#### 4. Quiz Yourself

Use the `quiz` command to generate questions that test your understanding of your own code.

```bash
coach quiz ./utils/helpers.py
```

**Example Output:**

```
Testing Your Knowledge for: ./utils/helpers.py
--------------------------------------------------

1.  In the `calculate_discount` function, what happens if the `price` is negative? Does the code handle this?
2.  What is the purpose of the `retries` variable in the `api_call` function?
3.  What is the expected return type of the `format_user_data` function?
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

*(This section would contain instructions on how to install the tool, for example, via pip or npm).*

```bash
# Example for a Python-based tool
pip install code-coach-cli

# Example for a Node.js-based tool
npm install -g code-coach-cli
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before first use, you need to configure your AI provider's API key. Code-Coach will look for an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

*   [ ] Support for more languages (JavaScript, Go, Java).
*   [ ] VS Code extension for real-time feedback in the editor.
*   [ ] Ability to define custom rules and best-practice documents for RAG.
*   [ ] Caching results to reduce API calls for unchanged code.
